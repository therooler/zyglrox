# zyglrox

zyglrox is a quantum computing simulator based on TensorFlow 1.x. I currently use this codebase for my PhD research and plan
to expand and improve it continuously. 

The most important features of zyglrox are

- GPU accelerated quantum computing.
- Batched quantum circuits.
- Simple interface to integrate other Tensorflow models.
- Clear documentation and simple examples to get started.

If you would like to know more or want to contribute send me a message!

quantum computing simulator.
